# dotfiles

This is my personal configuration, I don't expect anyone else to use this, it is up here as reference.

I have a [separate repository](https://github.com/purarue/seanb-utils) I push scripts up to with checks for dependencies to make them easier to install. That includes some cross-platform scripts which handle prompting for input/sending notifications etc. -- this repository is more application configuration files and personal scripts

This was originally linux-only, but over the months and years I've added a compatibility layer of sorts; A global `ON_OS` variable which uses [on_machine](https://github.com/purarue/on_machine) to figure out which machine/operating system I'm on. (`linux_arch`, `mac`, `android` ([termux](https://termux.com/)) or `windows` (WSL)) is set on X server/terminal launch. The bootstrap scripts in [`.config/yadm`](.config/yadm) dispatch against that to install different packages

In general:

- [`zsh`](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/), plugins/configuration handled manually in [`.config/zsh`](.config/zsh) (split across multiple files)
- [`yadm`](https://yadm.io) to manage dotfiles, see [`yadm-with-README.md`](.config/yadm/yadm-with-README.md)
- [`wezterm`](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) as terminal, [`alacritty`](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) on windows
- [`firefox-developer-edition`](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/firefox-developer-edition/) - browser, addons listed in [`firefox_addons.txt`](./.local/share/firefox_addons.txt)
- [`neomutt`](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt) for email
- [`nvim`](https://neovim.io/) (with LSP, completion, the typical modern plugins, see [`.config/nvim`](.config/nvim))
- [`todotxt`](http://todotxt.org/) for todos, with a [`rofi-interface`](.local/scripts/generic/todo-prompt) as GUI
- [`calcurse`](https://github.com/lfos/calcurse) as a calendar, with [some hooks](https://github.com/purarue/calcurse-load) to source other events. [menu bar icon](.config/i3blocks/blocks/b-calendar) displays what I have going on today
- [`ranger`](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) - terminal file manager, with a few [custom commands](.config/ranger/commands.py) to integrate [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), lots of [additional bindings](.config/ranger/rc.conf)/an [extensive preview script](.config/ranger/scope.sh), a [shell function](https://sean.fish/d/functions/ranger?dark) so `cd`ing in ranger changes my shell directory

I use [`syncthing`](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing) to sync my files/data across my computers.

On Arch/X11:

- [`i3-gaps`](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) - window manager; [config file](.config/i3/config) - [`i3-launcher`](https://sean.fish/d/i3-launcher?dark) reminds me of [my bindings for my launcher mode](https://i.imgur.com/m6q3L37.png)
- [`rofi`](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) - application launcher
- [`i3lock`](https://i3wm.org/i3lock/) for screen lock; [`daemon process`](.local/scripts/cross-platform/lock-screen) caches pixelated version of screen to speed up start time
- [`dunst`](https://dunst-project.org/) for notifications
- [`picom`](https://github.com/yshui/picom) for window compositing
- [`i3blocks`](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks) as a status bar

On Arch/[Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland):

- [`rofi` wayland fork](https://github.com/lbonn/rofi#wayland-support)
- [`waybar`](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) as a status bar
- [`kitty`](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) as a terminal (has better wayland support)

On Mac:

- Uses [`skhd`](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) as a hot-key daemon to run applications (e.g. `cmd + opt + enter` launches terminal)
- [`alfred`](https://www.alfredapp.com/) as a application launcher

On Android (using [Termux](https://termux.com/)):

Not a ton of application-specific setup yet, handles setting up `zsh`, installs all my packages using `apt`; see [`android_bootstrap`](./.config/yadm/android_bootstrap)

On Windows (in WSL):

Similar to Termux, does an `apt`-based install. Installs a bunch of languages/programs manually if since the versions on `apt` are ancient. Should install `yadm` manually, using:

`sh <(curl -sSL http://git.io/sinister) -u 'https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm/raw/master/yadm'`

---

- [.local/scripts/supervisor_jobs](.local/scripts/supervisor_jobs/) has jobs using [`supervisor`](https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor) to daemonize, so I dont have to write plists or systemd scripts, and background processes work mac, linux, and windows. That uses [`bgproc`](https://github.com/purarue/bgproc) as an anacron replacement, and [`on_machine`](https://github.com/purarue/on_machine) to figure out which jobs to run on each system/distribution
- [`ttt`](https://github.com/purarue/ttt/) is sprinkled throughout lots of my scripts, it acts as an extension to my shell history, saving commands from `i3` `bindsym`s, or `ranger` commands. [Lets me `cd`](.config/zsh/cd.zsh) to one of those directories quickly using `fzf`
- [.config/yadm](.config/yadm) includes lists of global packages to install for pacman/apt/brew, python, ruby, node, dart, rust, go, elixir and bash
- [.config/shortcuts.toml](.config/shortcuts.toml) - describes basic shell scripts that are created by [shortcuts](https://github.com/purarue/shortcuts)
- lots of other stuff in here:
  - [.local/scripts/generic](.local/scripts/generic/)
  - [.local/scripts/linux](.local/scripts/linux/)
  - [.local/scripts/cross-platform](.local/scripts/cross-platform/)

For a summary of tools I use often, see [here](https://sean.fish/x/notes/tools/).

### Install

    # on mac, run `xcode-select --install`
    yadm clone https://gitlab.com/purarue/dotfiles
    # restart the computer so that ~/.profile and zsh is setup properly
    # so OS detection can be done to install the correct packages
    yadm bootstrap
