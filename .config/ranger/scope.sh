# ranger supports enhanced previews.  If the option "use_preview_script"
# is set to True and this file exists, this script will be called and its
# output is displayed in ranger.  ANSI color codes are supported.

# NOTES: This script is considered a configuration file.  If you upgrade
# ranger, it will be left untouched. (You must update it yourself.)
# Also, ranger disables STDIN here, so interactive scripts won't work properly

# Meanings of exit codes:
# code | meaning    | action of ranger
# -----+------------+-------------------------------------------
# 0    | success    | success. display stdout as preview
# 1    | no preview | failure. display no preview at all
# 2    | plain text | display the plain content of the file
# 3    | fix width  | success. Don't reload when width changes
# 4    | fix height | success. Don't reload when height changes
# 5    | fix both   | success. Don't ever reload
# 6    | image      | success. display the image $cached points to as an image preview
# 7    | image      | success. display the file directly as an image

# shellcheck disable=SC2317
